<p>Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce</p>
<p>Indonesian satay, or "sate," is a popular dish consisting of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, often served with a rich peanut sauce. Originating from the diverse culinary traditions of Indonesia, satay is enjoyed across the archipelago with regional variations. The meat, typically chicken, beef, or lamb, is marinated in a blend of aromatic spices including turmeric, coriander, and cumin, imparting a unique and flavorful profile. After grilling to perfection over an open flame, the skewers are accompanied by a spicy, sweet, and savory peanut sauce, creating a delightful contrast of textures and tastes. This beloved street food is often garnished with a sprinkle of fried shallots and served with rice cakes or lontong, making it a hearty and satisfying meal.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, mix soy sauce, tomato sauce, peanut oil, garlic, black pepper, and cumin. Place chicken into the mixture, and stir to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes, but not overnight. This will make the meat too dark.</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill for high heat</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and saute onion and garlic until lightly browned. Mix in water, peanut butter, soy sauce, and sugar. Cook and stir until well blended. Remove from heat, mix in lemon juice, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade. Grill skewers about 5 minutes per side, until chicken juices run clear. Serve with the peanut sauce.</li>
